Welcome to my homepage! I'm Lang Lin, a first-year PhD student supervised by professor [Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/index.html) in the statistics track at [IROM](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-research/departments/irom/), [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). Previously, I earned my bachelor's degree at [Nanjing University](https://jw.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) (NJU), majoring in computer science within the national elite program. 

<!-- Currently, I'm a research intern at [OpenGVLab](https://github.com/OpenGVLab), affiliated with the [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/open), where I am fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Yi Wang](https://shepnerd.github.io/).   -->

I had the privilege of working at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC) and the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://github.com/ncsa), under the supervision of [Prof. Yu-Xiong Wang](https://yxw.web.illinois.edu/).  I was also an active member of NJU ACM/ICPC team. 

<!-- You can download my **CV** from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TOehCIetE-TVqvNI1r7Bc3N-yl3s8PBM/view?usp=sharing).   -->

My research interests lie broadly in generative models and large language models, with a particular focus on **diffusion models** and **multi-modal reasoning and generation**.

- **GLUS: Global-Local Reasoning Unified into A Single Large Language Model for Video Segmentation**  
**Lang Lin\***, Xueyang Yu\*, [Ziqi Pang\*](https://ziqipang.github.io/), [Yu-Xiong Wang](https://yxw.web.illinois.edu/)  
<em>The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2025</em>  
[[Project Page]](https://glus-video.github.io/)  
We propose a simple yet effective MLLMs for language-instructed video segmentation. It emphasizes global-local video understanding and achieves SOTA performance on multiple benchmarks.
