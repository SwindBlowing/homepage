Hello, welcome to my homepage! I'm Lang Lin, a senior undergraduate student from [Nanjing University](https://jw.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) (NJU), majoring computer science in elite class. Currently I work as a research intern at [OpenGVLab](https://github.com/OpenGVLab) affiliated to [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/open), mentored by [Dr. Yi Wang](https://shepnerd.github.io/). I was fortunated to work at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC) and [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://github.com/ncsa), supervised by [Prof. Yu-Xiong Wang](https://yxw.web.illinois.edu/). Before that, I was honored to work as a research intern in [Websoft](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/wiki/) at NJU, supervised by [Prof. Gong Cheng](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/~gcheng).

My research interest lies broadly in computer vision, especially in the fields of multi-modal segmentation, generation and video segmentation.

**I'm looking for a Ph.D. position starting in 2025 Fall. Please feel free to reach out!**
